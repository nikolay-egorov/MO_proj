# Robot-Movement
Project managing robot movement from starting point to goal giving max speed and obstacles coords. Uses A* algorithm to find optimal path
on a discrete map. Given a way, the task is to follow it with a max speed possible. Also a bit of insufficient genetic algorithm approach were used,
gives poor results on a more complex tests.
